# compressibleInterIsoLptFoam

## Features

- Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) solver for compressible flows coupled with Lagrangian library
- Conversion of small VoF elements to Lagrangian parcels to reduce computational cost
- Support for
  - Particle-particle interaction (collision, coalescence) and secondary breakup
  - Adaptive mesh refinement
  - Fully parallelized
- Based on interIsoFoam in [OpenFOAM v2112](https://www.openfoam.com).

## Compilation

 1. Clone the `CompressibleInterIso-LptFoam` gitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/2022ZM/CompressibleInterIso-LptFoam.git
```
 2. Use the `Allwmake` script to compile the `compressibleInterIsoLptFoam` solver and its corresponding library:
```
./Allwmake
```
